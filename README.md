##U-C Jobs

U-C Jobs is a website designed to provide a bridge between employers in China and talent applicants in United States.

There are two types of users: company user and job seeker user. 
Company user can edit its company's profile and post the hiring information. Also he/she can send/reply mails and messages from the job seeker users.
Job seeker user can edit his/her profile and upload his/her resume. Also he/she can show interest to some recruitment posts, leave message on company's page, and send mails directly to the company user.
Besides, when you are not a U-C Jobs member, you can view companies' profiles and their posts as a visitor.
